### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Chris. 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ... he/him

I've been writing code for a long time and I've seen things you people wouldn't believe.
Currently resting but trying to figure out what to do with my experience/skills/time that helps the world. 
Interested in pinball, computational theory, organization dynamics... pretty much anything complicated enough to engage deep thought. 
 
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ... a few side project ideas a friend brought to me, spending time with family #dadlife
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ... how to avoid climate collapse
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... anything, I'm a pretty open person and always willing to chat. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ... gotta think on that one, but this handle is in use across a number of services so feel free to ping where ever. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I was for a brief while ranked in the top 1000 competitive pinball players in the world. 

About me:
I tend to be an over communicator because I don't want to be misunderstood, but most people don't end up wanting all the information so I then start filtering my own thoughts and it can be difficult for me to tell when that becomes a problem. 
Most of life besides life itself is kind of a joke, but everybody has things they take seriously so we all need to be very respectful about all the jokes. Is this a joke?
